# Roman-Numerals
Program to convert roman numerals
I spent a little under 4 hours on the challenge. If I were to spend more time on the challenge I would develop my validRomanNumeral 
function to make sure that the roman numerals entered by the user are valid and I would simplify the functions that convert modern digits
to roman numerals.
